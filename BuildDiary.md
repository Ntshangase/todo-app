creating my angular todo-app.
The ChatGPT Bug has bitten me and i just want to build using ChatGPT.
I feel+Think that chatGPT will be more usefull in future, to me this seems like a real 
upgrade and i want to know how to get on top of the new wave and not sink.
I'm putting ChatGPT up there with Git in terms of usefullness in the software development community.
This is my first time using angular and  think it will be fun learning angular, shoutout to 
ZarTechRadio for pumping angular.
To enable auto completion run 'ng completion'
Angular seems fun.
installed angular on UBUNTU , which is currently the best workspace for me.
you do feel the I in AI when using chatGPT.ðŸ§ 
Asking chatGPT feels like asking a tutor who has cream explainations.

I'm done with the app now, let's rate my experience with building my first app using chatG:
Above expectations, I will definetly be using it in future  when building, and I can't stress
how much the I in AGI is loud, The responses are just pure cream, It's like milk from a reall cow 
now the one from the store.
